# Financial Engineering Project

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development and exploration of financial engineering concepts, including trading algorithms, portfolio optimization, risk simulation, financial models, forensic accounting, and API integrations. Designed with modularity and object-oriented programming principles at its core, this project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for quantitative analysis, trading strategy development and evaluation, machine learning model integration, and more.

## Modules

### Trading Algorithms (`trading_algos`)

The `trading_algos` module encompasses the development of various trading strategies, backtesting infrastructure, machine learning models for market prediction, and utility functions for data management. It is structured to facilitate easy experimentation with different strategies and models.

- Models: Includes base and machine learning models for predicting market movements.
- Strategies: Contains implementations of trading strategies.
- Backtesting: Provides tools for evaluating the performance of trading strategies.
- Utils: Utility functions and classes supporting data retrieval and technical indicators.
- Workflow: Orchestrates the process from data retrieval to backtesting.

### Portfolio Optimization

Tools and scripts for optimizing asset allocations in portfolios, leveraging modern portfolio theory, and other optimization techniques to maximize returns for given levels of risk.

### Risk Simulation

Simulations for assessing and managing financial risks, incorporating various models to forecast potential losses and evaluate the risk profiles of investment strategies.

### Financial Models

Implementation of various financial models for valuation, pricing, and analysis, including options pricing models, fixed income models, and equity valuation models.

### Forensic Accounting

Scripts and analyses for detecting anomalies in financial statements that could indicate fraud, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques.

### API

Integration with financial data APIs and the development of APIs to expose the project's functionalities, enabling automated data retrieval and the potential for real-time analysis and trading.
